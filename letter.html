<h3><strong id="第一章">What I wish I knew when I was 20</strong></h3>
<p style="margin-top:0.6em; font-size:1rem; color:#999">03/06/2025</p><br>

<p style="margin-top:0">
Hi Interns,</br></br>

Time is running. It's June.</br></br>

Writing this kind of email is something new and it feels awkward. It is like day one when you first step into the company. You are completely new to the environment, feel fresh, somehow excited yet nervous, and might even bring a hope that you are going to save the world after you learned how to save a PDF file.</br></br>

One week later, you get used to the routine and the dreams wither before it blossom due to repetitive workload: Customers non-stop calling to deploy the e-Invoice API, add intermediary, add QR, server migration, licence activation, perform system upgrade bugs after bugs fixed, solving miscellaneous problems while you still have to familiarize yourself with all the system functionality and terminology, let alone settling your own final school project.</br></br>

Before you realize you are doing the same robotic thing, day in, day out. Blink of an eye. It is already three or four months later, time's up. Your intern period comes to an end. You step out the company door for the one last time, you seem to have done a lot of things during the last 100 days in the office. You might start to reflect on what you gained (including body weight) during your brief internship. And how you feel depends entirely on how you interpret your time here.</br></br>

Whatever your experiences, I want to add some flavour to it to make it a bit different compared to your peers, not just a usual kind of experience where you come to the office early morning to check in, working around the clock and rush to check out to see your new balance. I mean work life balance is the new balance. Hang on a second, can't life be more fulfilling than that? Definitely, it can. It starts with a choice. The moment you decide your choice, change happens in a split second.</br></br>

That is the reason I am writing this email. If not because of you (the four interns), this email won't exist. But you did. Our lives are the sum of our choices. Somehow, four of you chose to come here. Somehow, 2025 is the year of AI where it did a great job in drafting the email you are currently reading. Somehow, as one of your seniors, I seldom offer a helping hand because I am busying sell fish. Both hands are rented to The Manhattan Fish Market in Subang Parade. But those who owe will need to repay in some form sooner or later. That day has come. It is today.</br></br>

As an intern, you contribute by assisting the support teams on various daily tasks, but remember that you should, and you must, especially in your twenties, to learn more and absorb like never before, like a SpongeBob. My role is to guide you to a higher level than when you first joined the company. To compensate, I am going to share with you some of the life lessons, about what I wish I knew when I was 20. If I had a time machine, the number one lesson would be...</br></br>

<h3><strong id="第二章">The meaning of life</strong></h3>
<p style="margin-top:0.6em; font-size:1rem; color:#999">06/06/2025</p><br>

<p style="margin-top:0">
Hi Interns,</br></br>

When you are no longer the youngest in the office, you will gaze up at the vast blue sky, pondering the meaning of life. You realize that at different stages of life, that meaning shifts. It is another Friday — similar in appearance, yet never truly the same.</br></br>

An internship marks the beginning of a new chapter. However, it is just one among many in the grand storybook of life. The company is a platform — a gateway to the real-world battlefield. You are the new player, stepping onto the field for the first time, starting from level zero.</br></br>

How do you upskill?</br></br>

In the first week, you undergo internal training, senior briefings about the basics of the system. It feels like a homeland playground, a safe zone where you sharpen your knife in preparation for the unknowns and brutal realities of working life.</br></br>

Then comes the second week — the real show. You start receiving calls from actual customers. They won’t bite, but in your imagination, they are ready to swallow your whole body. You scare yourself like a final destination. In your subconscious, they seem to know everything because you see yourself as new and unprepared. Those feelings, we all knew it. Each of us — including your future son and daughter — will have to face it one day, because that's simply part of life. No shortcuts, no exemptions.</br></br>

The fastest way to grow is to accept challenges, embrace reality, and volunteer to help customers — because in doing so, you help yourself the most. It’s the best way to learn. The feedback is real, not a controlled sandbox or test. And with real feedback comes responsibility. Responsibility shapes you. It’s what turns experience into maturity and starts the journey toward adulthood.</br></br>

Ten minutes of real-time combat with a customer via a TeamViewer session — guiding them step by step through adding an intermediary in the LHDN MyInvois Portal — is worth far more than an hour of internal training on e-Invoices. Because theory lays the groundwork, but reality demands adaptation, quick thinking, and actual problem-solving.</br></br>

Although life has lots of distractions, never forget the basics. The basics are the foundation. It is the original intention which linked back to the earlier question of what is the meaning of life. Life’s meaning isn’t found in chasing every distraction but in returning to the basics again and again — refining, questioning, and reaffirming what truly matters.</br></br>

Before we end here, my friend, Albert Einstein told me yesterday, "Wilber, you listen here, and you listen well. If you can't explain an e-Invoice to an intern, you don't understand it yourself." So far so good. My beloved interns never disappointed me because I never ask them to explain. Never ask, never disappointed. And you will live happily ever after.</br></br>

<h3><strong id="第三章">Think different</strong></h3>
<p style="margin-top:0.6em; font-size:1rem; color:#999">09/06/2025</p><br>

<p style="margin-top:0">
Hi Interns,</br></br>

You receive a call from a customer asking a question you do not know how to answer. Stay calm. First, get their name, contact information, and the problem. The first two are easy peasy, lemon squeezy. The real challenge starts with the problem. You will hear Rosé begin the game with, 'Apa cik? Apa cik? Apa masalah cik?'</br></br>

When a customer describes their problem, listen attentively. Restate the issue in your own words to ensure mutual understanding. Confirm that both of you are aligned in the conversation. Never assume — always clarify. Do not uh-huh uh-huh in anything you're not clear.</br></br>

The moment you engage with a customer, it’s not about having all the answers immediately, it’s about knowing how to find them. Be mindful that customers might take you on a detour to Holland, stopping by the iconic 'I amsterdam' to discuss irrelevant topics. Once you recognize the deviation, take the initiative by asking the right follow-up questions to peel back the layers until the real problem emerges. Don’t let the customer steer you off course. Take control. Protect your ship.</br></br>

Remember, whenever you encounter a new problem or error, always capture the message. Once you've solved it, document the solution. History tends to repeat itself because humans are forgetful. Store your solutions in a way that allows easy retrieval — consider using keywords or hashtags. Craft your own modus operandi. Refine them endlessly. They form your personal wiki — your evolving archive of wisdom. The one that nobody can take away from you.</br></br>

To truly understand how something works, write it down. List all the steps and visualize where things could go wrong. As you become familiar, the steps can be simplified. When you're learning something new, when you know nothing about the system or process, you have no choice but to absorb everything. Once you get the hang of it, you can start streamlining the steps. You'll recognize what you need and what you don’t, both are equally important in shaping the priorities of your life.</br></br>

Lastly, as a Gen Y speaking to Gen Z, I’d rather teach you how to eat an apple than simply hand you an iPhone. How? Take a bite of each apple to distinguish between sweet and sour, that’s how the Apple logo came to be. True teaching isn’t about handing over the latest gadget; it’s about igniting a hunger for firsthand exploration: taste, compare, decide. Gen Z, when you finally decide to bless me with an iPhone, you'll know exactly what to do, you already have my contact！</br></br>

<p style="margin-top:0">
Hi Interns,</br></br>

There’s always much to say, but when it comes to writing, the challenge is knowing where to begin. Batman Begins in 2005. It is now 2025. Two sentences with a period in between are 20 years apart. Time has never stopped moving forward. Neither should you. Do something or anything that can make your today better than yesterday.</br></br>

The world is a PlayStation — you choose your games. Embrace the transformative journey of becoming a better player, leveling up as you score higher and face increasingly difficult challenges along the way. Whatever obstacles ahead, keep growing stronger and evolving with the era. Turn your black hair into yellow, followed by the blue, just like Super Saiyan Son Goku.</br></br>

Nostalgia is part of being human, but we can't stay on Windows XP forever. The world is changing. If no action is taken, you'll be left behind. Even LHDN has hinted all the dinosaur versions are not supported, meaning you can't submit e-Invoice with the old hardware specs. So buckle up and get ready for the transition, whether it's to an i5, i7, i9, or the ultimate version: 'I love you x 3000.'</br></br>

Whatever issue you're facing has most likely been encountered by those who came before you. Seek their insights. Their wisdom can accelerate your learning curve. To some degree, progress depends largely on how predecessors pass down their knowledge to the next generation — it takes two to tango. This does not mean the journey is impossible. Rather, with selfless sharing, it transforms into a mission I’m possible.</br></br>

The way to tackle a problem is that, given enough time, you will know what to do. While this is partially correct, it is not entirely accurate. In a broader context, you must proactively identify what you need to understand and apply your curiosity to find an initial answer. That first answer may not be perfect, but with time and refinement, you will realize the process of getting an answer is far more precious than the answer itself.</br></br>

<h3><strong id="第五章">Your assignment</strong></h3>
<p style="margin-top:0.6em; font-size:1rem; color:#999">16/06/2025</p><br>

<p style="margin-top:0">
Hi Interns,</br></br>

Monday to Friday feels like a long journey, while Friday to Monday is never enough. Climbing five stories by stairs is always harder than taking an elevator up two floors. The question is why we need to climb the stairs on weekdays when an elevator is available. It seems that on workdays, we tend to forget the purpose of an elevator.</br></br>

Yes, it is the purpose that makes the difference.</br></br>

If you type ‘whoami’ in the CMD, you’ll see your computer name and current login user. But that’s just an identity, it doesn’t end there. You have to find your purpose and determine what you are pursuing. Give that identity a reason to act with meaning. The journey comes alive the moment you know what you truly madly deeply want in your heart. No one else can tell you, only you and Savage Garden know.</br></br>

Why do we think finding a purpose is difficult? It’s not add math, you do not need to know how to calculate a log. But you do need to keep a daily log for contemplation. Life is simple. We are the ones who make it complicated. Sometimes, somehow we just lose focus without realizing it. Keep it simple and real. Regain clarity, reclaim vision, and reevaluate. The ultimate purpose can be as simple as finding happiness in what you do.</br></br>

Here is a story from my friend, John Lennon.</br></br>

"When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down 'happy'. They told me I didn't understand the assignment, and I told them they didn't understand life."</br></br>

Today is Monday. The beginning of another long journey. Is this journey unbearable or exciting? It all depends on your purpose. Another week, another opportunity for you to strive, to know yourself better, and to evolve into an improved version of who you were. It's all a matter of perspective. I hope you won’t feel exhausted. There is always a lift out there.</br></br>

<h3><strong id="第六章">Your mistake</strong></h3>
<p style="margin-top:0.6em; font-size:1rem; color:#999">20/06/2025</p><br>

<p style="margin-top:0">
Hi Interns,</br></br>

Some mistakes come from the actions we don't take; others from the ones we overtake; and the rest from not knowing what we're doing until someone points it out.</br></br>

Clock is running faster than the Kenyans. Here comes another last working day of the week. Say yo! Sean Kingston? No no no. Say yeah! It’s Friday. Time for an essay. I feel out of title. Don’t really know what to say. But if you’re reading this, it means the episode continues. It would be a mistake to stop writing. We all make mistakes. I know that day is inevitable, sooner or later. But not today.</br></br>

In the past week, have you made any mistakes? If yes, congratulations! Your mistake scoreboard is in flying colors. If not, please report to the headmaster’s office after working hours. The principal needs to speak with you about why you aren’t making any mistakes. Are you a robot? Are you an AI? Even artificial intelligence makes mistakes, and you don’t? How on earth is that possible? You must be from Mars. Or perhaps... you must be out of your mind.</br></br>

To make no mistakes is a mistake in itself. I’m not encouraging you to pursue every misstep. Rather, there are many types of mistakes. One of them is that, in theory, you know it’s wrong, but you still have to do it wrong yourself to truly taste it. Once you taste it, it lasts longer than any of your life partners. Mistakes become a part of you. You are who you are because of the mistakes you've made. If you're lucky, you learn from them. If you're not, well… tattoo is a mistake. Sorry, I mean that too is a mistake. Now? It's too late to apologize.</br></br>

Another mistake is believing everything you read without verifying it. As a grown-up, it's your responsibility to justify things with your own reasoning. Take the good, filter out the bad, and blend it into your unique personality. You know what suits you best. So follow not the herd, but the voice within. You’ve got to figure it out for yourself. Don’t just copy and paste — copy, verify, then paste.</br></br>

Your mistake... should you choose to accept it. Accept it. Then move on. Like today, the pen still moves.</br></br>

<button onclick="document.getElementById('id06').style.display='block'" class="buttonGeneral buttonBtoW centerbuttonBtoW open-sans-wilber">Mistake. Designed for humans.</button>

<h3><strong id="第七章">Connecting the dots</strong></h3>
<p style="margin-top:0.6em; font-size:1rem; color:#999">23/06/2024</p><br>

<p style="margin-top:0">
Hi Interns,</br></br>

I'm not sure whether you're required to write a weekly report for your school supervisor during your internship. Most likely you are — because three things in life are certain: death, taxes, and education. Death is about life — life is short. Tax is about happiness — you can't make everyone happy. Education is about change — but the school system never really changes.</br></br>

I had to write reports when I was still an intern, around your age. That was more than ten years ago. Looking back, the content I wrote wasn’t helpful at all. “What’s the weather today?” “What’s for lunch?” “How I met your mother?” I didn’t know how to write a proper report back then. It became redundant, repetitive, just a boring daily routine dressed up as a diary. The report lacked soul. It died the moment it was submitted to the school. But it shouldn’t have been like that. It should’ve been timeless. It should’ve been alive. It should've lasted longer than the relationship with your mother.</br></br>

While in the office, the time you spend with colleagues often far outweighs the time spent with your boyfriend, girlfriend, cat, dog or a secret lover. With this amount of interaction, seniors can observe what improvements are needed, which skills can be polished, and which practices should be corrected. Practice makes perfect, but only when the practice is perfect. Otherwise, practice reinforces mistakes, making things worse and requiring more time to unlearn and relearn.</br></br>

Seniors simply need to offer guidance. It's like teaching a child. First to crawl, then walk, run, sprint, and eventually leap into the universe, floating through space to witness the beauty of Earth through their own imagination. Life is beautiful. You’re beautiful. That’s true. From experience, I’ve found this approach far more effective when seniors dedicate a little time to write a brief report for the interns. A simple gesture — passing the torch — can illuminate a brighter future. A small decision with a big impact. After all, the world belongs to the younger generation. We are not forever 21. One day, you too.</br></br>

The email I sent to you:</br>
1) What I wish I knew when I was 20</br>
2) The meaning of life</br>
3) Think different</br>
4) What is your superpower</br>
5) Your assignment</br>
6) Your mistake</br>
7) Connecting the dots (Today)</br></br>

All experiences are interrelated, whether personal or not. No step is ever wasted. You simply have to clarify them, combine them, and connect the dots. Over time, the image will begin to reveal itself. My friend Steve Jobs told me, “You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward.” Once you understand the meaning of life, your perspective shifts by thinking differently. You discover your superpower, define your assignment — your mission in life — and move toward fulfilling it. Along the way, you learn from your mistakes. You grow stronger and wiser. You gather all seven Dragon Balls. And finally… you make a wish. This is what I wish I knew when I was about your age or even earlier. It’s a looping life concept that keeps you moving forward by connecting all the dots.</br></br>

Hi Interns,</br></br>

Tomorrow is a holiday. Time for McDonald's slogan — I'm lovin' it. Uncle Donald's dream is to Make America Great Again. One of his latest posts on Truth Social said, "No one goes on vacation until it's done." The POTUS is rushing to get Congress to pass his "Big, Beautiful" bill, and we're racing to update the third batch of customers to be e-Invoice compatible, starting July 1st. You are not alone. Everyone has their own mission to accomplish. We just need to stay focused on our part.</br></br>

I believe you start to feel like the work never ends, especially as the calendar approaches the second half of the year. The warm-up is over. Now it's time for the real play. A play intense enough to burn you out if you can't handle the heat, both from within and from the scorching weather outside. This is a simulation of a real world environment. This is something you can sense within yourself, and only you will know whether you enjoy your 9-to-5 work or if you'd prefer to try something different.</br></br>

The trajectory of your life depends on each decision you make. Standing at a crossroads, it’s time to make a choice, a choice to discover your own remedy, a kind of cool-down strategy that’s fundamentally built upon the foundation of your dream. Only a lucky few seem to find direction quickly. For the rest of us, things feel a little blurry, we can't even decide what to eat for lunch, let alone figure out what our dream is.</br></br>

We always back up the system before upgrading a program for the customer. But in life, can we get a second chance if we do something wrong? It depends. Life doesn’t have a Ctrl + Z button. However, as humans, we possess the ability to reflect and learn from our mistakes. Be like water my friend, we must be resilient. Embrace the idea that a “wrong” decision often leads us to a different kind of wisdom. With this mindset, we’re always in a win-win situation, no matter what decision we make. Every experience refines us in ways we didn’t anticipate.</br></br>

I have a dream. Four working days and three days off. That’s the perfect balance. This week, I'm living that dream. What about yours? Is it about traveling? If yes, then just go for it. Buy the ticket, plan the itinerary, apply for leave now. I approve it for you. We are not part of the Trump administration. We are Gen Z.</br></br>

Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become.</br></br>

<h3><strong id="第九章">Lesson from a movie</strong></h3>
<p style="margin-top:0.6em; font-size:1rem; color:#999">30/06/2025</p><br>

<p style="margin-top:0">
Hi Interns,</br></br>

If what I remember about the year 2020 is COVID, then the year 2025 is definitely the year of AI. Without AI, you wouldn't be able to read this letter, because my original words had so many grammar mistakes. Somehow, AI has become my English teacher. It tidies up the language while keeping my voice intact.</br></br>

My university course was Information Technology. At that time, there were four major subjects to choose from: Software Engineering, Computer Networks, Information Management, and Intelligent Systems. Everyone who took the IT course had to make a choice. Honestly, I didn’t know what to pick. I feel like the course chose me more than I chose it.</br></br>

Deep in my heart, I know coding isn’t my favorite; touching cables isn’t my cup of tea; managing information doesn’t feel right to me. But intelligence? That sounds special. It's like Uncle Roger’s fried rice. What makes it so special? I don't know. But… Fuiyoh! That “Fuiyoh!” is more than enough to fuel me through a four-year degree journey, majoring in AI.</br></br>

Fast forward 10 years, I’m not sure how you’ll feel about today’s technology. Personally, I recognize 2025 as the year of AI. DeepSeek (a kind of monster that races a Go-Kart in Formula 1 but still manages to win) was introduced during Chinese New Year. After the CNY holidays, our boss asked the R&D team to study the monster, not just the Monster series from Labubu, with the goal of integrating them into the system to enhance its existing capabilities.</br></br>

Not long after that, ChatGPT made headlines and trended on social media for its Ghibli-style image generator feature. Since then, names like Copilot, Gemini, Grok, and others have slowly begun to appear to the public. Each day, they become more intelligent. These tools are incredibly useful in daily tasks: refining my kindergarten-level HTML code into a stylish "one thousand songs in your pocket" button, extracting text from images into editable Excel files, assisting with language learning (I can now speak watashi wa anata no okāsan fluently!), and more. And by "more," I mean the only limit to AI is your imagination.</br></br>

When I watch a movie, I always try to figure out what lesson can we learn from it, even if it's just a single line of dialogue from a character. It must have a deep meaning, because I can still remember it years after walking out of the cinema. When it comes to AI, one movie that comes to mind is The Matrix. There's a scene where <a href="video/matrix.mp4" target="_blank">Neo points to a helicopter</a> and asks Trinity, “Can you fly that thing?” She calls the operator, and within 30 seconds, she knows how to fly it. Neo achieves his objective.</br></br>

Ask the right question, and you'll get the right answer. The quality of your answer depends on the quality of your question. The AI tools we mentioned earlier are similar to Trinity’s capabilities. I believe what we need in this fast-changing world is to become like Neo: do what you can (ask the right questions), with what you have (utilize AI tools), where you are (in 2025). Becoming Neo is not just simpler but better than Trinity.</br></br>

I forgot what I learned in university. The AI tools that boomed this year brought me back to the old times. In retrospect, I’ve realized that learning how to use the resources available is another way to thrive. Maybe your passion isn’t in building the tools themselves. Maybe it lies in using them to create something else. That would be awesome as hell. You just have to find what drives you. What keeps the momentum, the endorphins, the dopamine flowing. This is a lifelong homework. Because we change over time, we must stay true to ourselves and keep searching.</br></br>

六点放工，如果准时回，你会在楼下碰见一个穿 New Balance 的男生。他在等一个人。</br></br>

从外表来看，他一身白领上班族风格、戴上眼镜、系上腰带，像是马来西亚十大杰出青年的第十位。</br></br>

每一次碰见他，眼神会不自觉停留在他那双独特的 N 牌鞋子。对一个人产生好感，不复杂，只要你喜欢 New Balance，我就喜欢你。</br></br>

可惜当这双 New Balance 穿在一身 formal attire，左看右看怎么看都要扣一分。他就这样失去平衡，掉出十大杰出青年排行榜。</br></br>

这个男生，我们就叫他 New Balance 吧。</br></br>

偶尔，我准时放工，第一个从 office 跑出来。我习惯用楼梯走下去。听到脚步声的 New Balance，以为我是他在等的人，赶快转身就要飞扑过来。</br></br>

我们两个眼神对望，还没来得及确认，梁静茹躲在角落，唱起可惜不是你，他急忙把身体转开，眼神也移开，我还能怎样，只能看着他背影，我知道他要的不是我。</br></br>

公司有两位女 interns，今年二十岁。New Balance 是其中一位的男朋友。</br></br>

New Balance 也在附近实习，下班时间比我们早半小时。每次他会把车先 park 在附近的 LRT station，然后走到我们公司等她女朋友，再和她一起走回去。</br></br>

LRT 离我们公司大约 400 米，也就是跑道绕一圈。为了女朋友，他可以多绕一圈，所以要穿 New Balance，掉出十大杰青也无所谓。你懂什么是爱情吗？你没穿过 New Balance，你不懂的啦。</br></br>

另一个同事，他爸爸也时常把车停在 LRT 附近的 Shell 油站等他。我好奇他爸爸为什么不会像 New Balance 那样步行过来我们公司，再陪他儿子走回去。你懂什么是亲情吗？步行就是不行嘛。</br></br>

看着我们家的 Intern 和 New Balance 牵着小指头一起走回 LRT 站，那个平淡却幸福的画面，是爱情二十岁该有的模样。千万不要变，这样蛮好的，简单、善良、又那么努力。</br></br>

月尾了，银行 no balance 没关系。看到 New Balance 心情变好最重要。六点了，还不回家吗？再不回，楼下的 New Balance 差不多要变 Old Balance 了。</br></br>

放工以后，不早点回，也要准时回。我们每个都有属于自己的一双 New Balance 在等着自己回家。</br></br>
